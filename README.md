# vvc
Virtual visit card (vc).
Small website presenting user's visit card. Data regarding the user is stored in mysql database. It can be used both on computer and phone connected to internet. Index page includes query in the URL path (q=username). Username is also the search key in database. 
The site can create vc for outlook, share it (on a phone) and send request to google charts to create qr code of link to the website with query to the user.
I used two mysql users: one for data presentaion (SELECT) and second one for inserting, updating and deleting and is used in python module for updating users in the database.
